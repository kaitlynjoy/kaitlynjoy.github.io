[Line25](http://line25.com/), a blog for web creatives, has been an invaluable source of inspiration and a challenge to create better web projects. The blog mostly provides collection of helpful tutorials, resources, articles, and websites, providing inspiration and knowledge to anyone in the web industry.

### My Favorite Posts from Line25

By far, my favorite posts from Line25 are the Sites of the Week. See [this example](http://line25.com/inspiration/line25-sites-of-the-week-for-july-3rd-2015), of the sites of the week of July 3rd, 2015.

This weekly digest of great websites captures every type of website, even websites in other languages. It's crazy to see how I can enjoy and understand websites in other languages, just by how the site was designed.

### Unique Ideas

Looking at these sites, I'm inspired to try new layouts and features, and break out of the routine, predictable structure of the "classic web design." Each design is beautiful and usable in its own way, and is a constant reminder that a website does not need to look a certain way, or portray information with a certain method in order for it to be successful.

For example take a look at these two websites. They are both web development companies, but their approach to their websites are very different, but both equally effective:

#### 1. Big Drop

#### 2. Lounge Lizard
