This week, while interning at Rock My Image, I’ve learned the importance of securing your Wordpress sites, keeping them safe from hackers, bots, and evil software. You may wonder, why would anyone want to attack a poor little Wordpress site? Well, it happens a lot, and here’s some of the ways I’ve learned to prevent it.

1. **Keep Wordpress up to date**. Wordpress releases updates with the loads of bug fixes and extra security. If your site is running on the latest version of WordPress, you’ve got a solid barrier against attack.

2. **Update your plugins**. Similarly to updating WordPress, plugin updates address security issues found in previous versions.

3. **Speaking of plugins**, use a good security plugin. I have used iTheme Security, which comes with tons of options. You will be able to customize to your heart’s content, and sleep soundly, knowing your site is secure.

4. **Delete the stuff you don’t use**. Have any deactivated plugins or random files that you’re holding on to for no reason? Unknown files can be breeding grounds for vulnerabilities. Rip the bandaid off quick and get rid of them.

So why should you go to all this trouble? My site’s doing just fine, you say. Believe me, take the extra couple minutes now, and protect yourself from hours of work cleaning out a hacked site later.
